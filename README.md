## 📅 Schedule & Tasks

### Day 3: Infrastructure Setup (Monday, 1/12)

**Goal:** Get your coding environment (GitHub Codespaces) ready.

1. **GitHub Account:** Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com) if you don't have one. Choose a professional username!
2. **Join Classroom:** Click the [GitHub Classroom Link Here].
3. **Accept Assignment:** Click accept, refresh after a moment, and click **Go to repository**.
4. **Launch Codespaces:** Click the green **Code** button → **Codespaces** tab → **Create codespace on main**.
5. **Coding Task:** * Open `lab1_3.py` and add this code:
```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

```


* Run `test_3.py` to verify.



### Day 4: Functions (Wednesday, 1/14)

**Goal:** Practice writing individual functions.

1. Re-open your Codespace from your GitHub profile.
2. Complete the tasks described inside `lab1_4.py`.
3. Run `test_4.py` to verify your solution.

### Day 5: Boolean Logic (Friday, 1/16)

**Goal:** Learn how to write your own tests.

1. Open `lab1_5.py` and complete the logic exercises.
2. Run `test_5.py` to verify your solution.

## 🐍 New to Python?

If this is your first time working with Python files and a Command Line (Terminal), here are the basics:

### What is a `.py` file?

A file ending in `.py` is a plain text file that contains instructions written in the Python programming language. Think of it like a recipe: the computer reads the file from top to bottom and executes the instructions you've written.

### How to run code via the Command Line

The **Terminal** (the black box at the bottom of Codespaces) is where you talk directly to the computer.

* **To run a script:** Type `python3` followed by the filename and hit Enter.
```bash
python3 lab1_3.py

```


* **To run tests:** In this lab, we use scripts to check our work. Run them the same way:
```bash
python3 test_3.py

```

## 📥 Submission Instructions

Once you finish Day 5, follow these steps in Codespaces to turn in your work:

1. **Stage:** Click the **Source Control** icon (the branch symbol ) on the left sidebar. Hover over "Changes" and click the **+ (Plus Sign)**.
2. **Commit:** In the text box, type a message (e.g., `Completed Lab 1`). Click **Commit**.
3. **Push:** Click **Sync Changes** or **Push** to send your code to GitHub.
4. **Verify:** Refresh your GitHub repository page in your browser. If you see your commit message next to the files, you are successful!

**Final Check:** Confirm with your Instructor or TA that your submission was received.
